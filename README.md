## The puzzle

The puzzle involves fitting together 6 blocks each with 2 sides and 3 slots on each side which can have a hole, a bump, or nothing.

The blocks are as follows, the images showing both sides of the blocks:

The aim is to find a configuration of the blocks such that we can stack 3 of them on top of the other 3 and the inner surface mates properly. Below is an example of a valid solution (where the side on the right is the inner surface, ie its mirrored but both faces mate if closed like 2 sides of a book):

Note that the stacked pieces can be horizontally rotated relative to each other to fit.
